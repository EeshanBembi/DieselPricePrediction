# DieselPricePrediction
I designed a univariate LSTM as asked in the assignment.For the sake of ease i splitted the dataset into two files diesel_train and diesel_test into 80% and 20% values respectively.I could have used train_test_split() method but this way reflected more sleekness.



Epoch: A full pass over all of your training data.
Loss: A scalar value that we attempt to minimize during our training of the model. The lower the loss, the closer our predictions are to the true labels.
